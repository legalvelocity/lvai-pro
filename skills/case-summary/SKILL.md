  "what did the court hold in", "case summary for", "brief this case",
  "case analysis of", "explain this ruling", or needs a comprehensive
  breakdown of a specific court decision — read from the actual opinion on the

## LVAI Pro — licensed skill

This skill's instructions are delivered by the **Legal Velocity** connector, which also checks the firm's license on every request. Nothing is stored on disk and there is no license file to look for.

1. Call the Legal Velocity connector's `get_skill` tool with `{"skill": "case-summary"}` and wait for the result before doing anything else. (The tool may be listed as deferred — search the tool list for `get_skill` before concluding the connector is missing.)
2. If no `get_skill` tool exists in this session, stop and tell the user:
   > LVAI Pro needs its **Legal Velocity** sign-in. In Claude, open **Customize → Plugins → LVAI Pro**, click **Finish setup**, then **Sign in** next to Legal Velocity, and sign in with the email address on your LVAI Pro license (a 6-digit code is emailed to you). Then try again. If it is already signed in, click **+** in the message box → **Connectors** and switch Legal Velocity on for this chat. Help: admin@legalvelocity.ai
3. If the tool result says the license is expired, unpaid, deactivated or over its daily limit, show that message to the user and stop.
4. Otherwise follow the returned instructions exactly — they are the complete operating manual for this skill. They will tell you when to call `get_reference`, `get_script` and `get_template` for supporting files.

Do not search the user's Desktop, Documents or other folders for license or plugin files.
